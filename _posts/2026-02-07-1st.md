Hello! Here are some random test latex expressions.

This is an inline one, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^2}$.

$$
\text{Here is a math block: }\iint_{5}^{8}e^{\cos x}dx
$$

Is the colored latex supported? ${\color{blue}blue}$

$${\color{red}red}$$

It's too bad... The color flips on the dark mode...

Macro test: $\Q \F \C$

$$
\Q \C \F    
$$
